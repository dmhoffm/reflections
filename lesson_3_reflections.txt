When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when I want to share it and/or back it up to the cloud

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may have work in progress that you want stable until you are ready to reconcile it with the remote changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks when you want to make a variant on github of another's github repository and you may not have write access; clone when you want to make a local variant of another's repository on the same or different machine(it will be managed independently if local); branch when you want to make a variant of your repository and have it managed as part of that repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?


You can use the local git tools to operate on the remote branch, including merge, diff and log
