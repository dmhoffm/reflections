When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when I want to share it and/or back it up to the cloud

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may have work in progress that you want stable until you are ready to reconcile it with the remote changes
