How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it showed me context and the two lines so I could easily see what changed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it allows me to see specific changes and recall earlier changes quickly, including detecting typos

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    saving work with automatic vs logical breakpoints vs manually saved

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    git supports programming which usually entails configurations of multiple files, google docs usually is operating on one file at a time and the files don't need to be synced up exactly in time with the other files on the google drive

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives the commit history and git diff gives the files changed between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can easily go back and revert changes because my prior version aren't lost

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for version control and configuration management of my application program files
